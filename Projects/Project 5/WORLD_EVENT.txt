	   Jeff Chong

Responsiblities:
Jeff: Ray classes and behaviors.

Philippe: Mouse interaction, background updating, and affected entities.

2.) Click anywhere on the grid to spawn a Sting Ray.

3.) A Sting Ray will spawn and will come up from underneath the sand, revealing 9 sand tiles.

4.) Crabs are the effected entity. They are removed when within reach of Sting Ray (RayNotFull).
Updated crab activity: When a crab cuts a seagrass that has a sand tile background, a new Sting Ray 
(RayNotFull) is spawned.
Seagrass tile backgrounds are changed to sand tiles when within reach of a Sting Ray (RayFull).

5.) The new entity is a StringRay and similar to the Octo, it has two states, RayNotFull & RayFull
RayNotFull: Hunts a crab and eats it. It then transforms to a RayFull
RayFull: Runs to a seagrass and is removed.
(Refer to Question 4 for what happened to the crabs and seagrass)

NOTE: Depending on when the ray(s) are spawned into the world, the whole ecosystem of fish and crabs are affected. This may lead to no crabs spawning to cut the seagrass.
The program will run indefinitely as fish keep spawning because no crabs exist to remove seagrass.
